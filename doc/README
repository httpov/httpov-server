HTTPov server: Getting the jobs done

The server has no web interface, and is controlled from within the MySQL
client.



The basic way of pointing out an animation job is:
==================================================
INSERT INTO job SET name='<jobname>', frames=<frames>, sliced=0,
    rows=<imageheight>, count=<batchsize>, clients=<clients>, 
    issued=UNIX_TIMESTAMP();

<jobname> is the name of the zip file, excluding ".zip".

<frames> is most likely the KFF number in the pov.ini file in the zip file.
Some interesting effects can be acheived by letting them differ.

<imageheight> should match +H in the pov.ini file.

<count> is the number of frames that should be sent out in each batch; for
very long animations consisting of very simple frames, a number larger
than 1 could improve the performance. In cases where the frame rendering
time is much larger than the HTTP communication time, 1 should be
adequate.

<clients> is the maximum number of clients that are allowed to process
this job at the same time. 0 is unlimited.


The basic way of pointing out a single image is:
================================================
INSERT INTO job SET name='<jobname>', frames=1, sliced=1,
    rows=<imageheight>, count=<lines>, clients=<clients>,
    issued=UNIX_TIMESTAMP();

<imageheight> is the height of the image, as specified by H in the pov.ini
file.

<lines> is the number of lines that should be rendered in each batch.

frames should be set to 1 in the database, and +KFF2 in pov.ini,
because we want to trigger POV-Ray's handling of multiple files.

<clients> is the maximum number of clients that are allowed to process
this job at the same time. 0 is unlimited.



The basic way of pointing out a sliced animation is:
========================================================
INSERT INTO job SET name='<jobname>', frames=<frames>, sliced=1,
    rows=<imageheight>, count=<lines>, clients=<clients>,
    issued=UNIX_TIMESTAMP();

<jobname> is the name of the zip file, excluding ".zip".

<frames> is most likely the KFF number in the pov.ini file in the zip file.
Some interesting effects can be acheived by letting them differ.

<imageheight> should match +H in the pov.ini file.

<lines> is the number of lines that should be rendered in each batch.

<clients> is the maximum number of clients that are allowed to process
this job at the same time. 0 is unlimited.



Aborting a running job:
=======================
UPDATE job SET aborted=NOW() where id=<jobid>;

<jobid> is the id of the affected job. It may or may not be
the last job, depending on whether there are queued jobs or not.

The clients will continue working on their batches, but be denied to
upload them when finished, and told to get a new job instead.
