The file tree should be installed in this manner:
=================================================
  some_directory/
    httpov/            <-- The server's document root
      jobs/
      httpov.php
    safe_directory/
    httpov_conf.php

Make sure the server is allowed to write to safe_directory, as this is
where all finished batches will be stored, out of reach for ordinary
web clients. httpov_conf.php should also reside _outside_ the web root,
as it contains database passwords.

PHP:
====
If the rendered images are produced for HD animations, their size can 
easily outgrow the default PHP settings, causing the uploads to fail.

Please make sure that 'upload_max_filesize' and 'post_max_size' in 
php.ini are set to values that allow the entire batches to be uploaded.

MySQL:
======
Using the mysql command line client should suffice to create the
HTTPov database and associated tables:

mysql -u<user> -p <httpov.sql

Upgrading from server 0.6:
==========================
The new clients limit feature requires one additional column in
the job and batch table each, but apart from that, upgrading 
should be no more difficult than simply replacing httpov.php 
with the new version.

ALTER TABLE job ADD COLUMN clients int(11) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE batch ADD COLUMN active int(11) NOT NULL;

Use of x.2 clients is required for limiting to work.

Upgrading from server 0.5:
==========================
The new client group feature requires one additional column in
the batch table, but apart from that, upgrading should be no 
more difficult than simply replacing httpov.php with the new
version.

ALTER TABLE batch ADD COLUMN cgroup varchar(50) NOT NULL;
